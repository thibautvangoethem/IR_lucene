<table> <tr><th>answers</th></tr><tr><td><p>The best way that I know of because of leap years and everything is:</p>

<pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>DateTime birthDate = new DateTime(2000,3,1);
int age = (int)Math.Floor((DateTime.Now - birthDate).TotalDays / 365.25D);
</code></pre>
</tr></td><tr><td><p>Another function, not by me but found on the web and refined it a bit:</p>

<pre><code>public static int GetAge(DateTime birthDate)
{
    DateTime n = DateTime.Now; // To avoid a race condition around midnight
    int age = n.Year - birthDate.Year;

    if (n.Month &lt; birthDate.Month || (n.Month == birthDate.Month &amp;&amp; n.Day &lt; birthDate.Day))
        age--;

    return age;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just two things that come into my mind: What about people from countries that do not use the Gregorian calendar? DateTime.Now is in the server-specific culture I think. I have absolutely zero knowledge about actually working with Asian calendars and I do not know if there is an easy way to convert dates between calendars, but just in case you're wondering about those Chinese guys from the year 4660 :-)</p>
