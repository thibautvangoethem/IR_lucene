<p>Is there a performance benefit to replacing <code>==</code> with <code>===</code>? </p>

<p>Any performance improvement would be welcomed as many comparison operators exist.</p>

<p>If no type conversion takes place, would there be a performance gain over <code>==</code>?</p>
<table> <tr><th>answers</th></tr><tr><td><p>Let me add this counsel:</p>
<p><em><strong>If in doubt, read the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" rel="noreferrer">specification</a>!</strong></em></p>
<p>ECMA-262 is the specification for a scripting language of which JavaScript is a dialect. Of course in practice it matters more how the most important browsers behave than an esoteric definition of how something is supposed to be handled. But it is helpful to understand why <strong>new String(&quot;a&quot;) !== &quot;a&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>Please let me explain how to read the specification to clarify this question. I see that in this very old topic nobody had an answer for the very strange effect. So, if you can read a specification, this will help you in your profession tremendously. It is an acquired skill. So, let's continue.</p>
<p>Searching the PDF file for === brings me to page 56 of the specification: <strong>11.9.4. The Strict Equals Operator ( === )</strong>, and after wading through the specificationalese I find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>11.9.6 The Strict Equality Comparison Algorithm</strong><br>
The comparison x === y, where x and y are values, produces <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>. Such a comparison is performed as follows:<br>
  1. If Type(x) is different from Type(y), return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  2. If Type(x) is Undefined, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
  3. If Type(x) is Null, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
  4. If Type(x) is not Number, go to step 11.<br>
  5. If x is <strong>NaN</strong>, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  6. If y is <strong>NaN</strong>, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  7. If x is the same number value as y, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
  8. If x is +0 and y is ?0, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
  9. If x is ?0 and y is +0, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
  10. Return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  11. If Type(x) is String, then return <strong>true</strong> if x and y are exactly the same sequence of characters (same length and same characters in corresponding positions); otherwise, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  12. If Type(x) is Boolean, return <strong>true</strong> if x and y are both <strong>true</strong> or both <strong>false</strong>; otherwise, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  13. Return <strong>true</strong> if x and y refer to the same object or if they refer to objects joined to each other (see 13.1.2). Otherwise, return <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting is step 11. Yes, strings are treated as value types. But this does not explain why <strong>new String(&quot;a&quot;) !== &quot;a&quot;</strong>. Do we have a browser not conforming to ECMA-262?</p>
<p>Not so fast!</p>
<p>Let's check the types of the operands. Try it out for yourself by wrapping them in <strong>typeof()</strong>. I find that <strong>new String(&quot;a&quot;)</strong> is an object, and step 1 is used: return <strong>false</strong> if the types are different.</p>
<p>If you wonder why <strong>new String(&quot;a&quot;)</strong> does not return a string, how about some exercise reading a specification? Have fun!</p>

<p>Aidiakapi wrote this in a comment below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the specification</p>
<p><strong>11.2.2 The new Operator</strong>:</p>
<p>If Type(constructor) is not Object, throw a TypeError exception.</p>
<p>With other words, if String wouldn't be of type Object it couldn't be used with the new operator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>new</strong> always returns an Object, even for <strong>String</strong> constructors, too. And alas! The value semantics for strings (see step 11) is lost.</p>
<p>And this finally means: <strong>new String(&quot;a&quot;) !== &quot;a&quot;</strong>.</p>

</tr></td><tr><td><p>The strict equality operator (<code>===</code>) behaves identically to the abstract equality operator (<code>==</code>) except no type conversion is done, and the types must be the same to be considered equal.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="http://www.c-point.com/javascript_tutorial/jsgrpComparison.htm" rel="noreferrer">Javascript Tutorial: Comparison Operators</a></p>

<p>The <code>==</code> operator will compare for equality <em>after doing any necessary type conversions</em>.  The <code>===</code> operator will <strong>not</strong> do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type <code>===</code> will simply return <code>false</code>. Both are equally quick.</p>

<p>To quote Douglas Crockford's excellent <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596517742" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JavaScript has two sets of equality operators: <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>, and their evil twins <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>.  The good ones work the way you would expect.  If the two operands are of the same type and have the same value, then <code>===</code> produces <code>true</code> and <code>!==</code> produces <code>false</code>.  The evil twins do the right thing when the operands are of the same type, but if they are of different types, they attempt to coerce the values.  the rules by which they do that are complicated and unmemorable.  These are some of the interesting cases:</p>

<pre><code>'' == '0'           // false
0 == ''             // true
0 == '0'            // true

false == 'false'    // false
false == '0'        // true

false == undefined  // false
false == null       // false
null == undefined   // true

' \t\r\n ' == 0     // true
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lack of transitivity is alarming.  My advice is to never use the evil twins.  Instead, always use <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>.  All of the comparisons just shown produce <code>false</code> with the <code>===</code> operator.</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>A good point was brought up by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/165495/casebash">@Casebash</a> in the comments and in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/113570/philippe-leybaert">@Phillipe Laybaert's</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/957602/1288">answer</a> concerning objects.  For objects, <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> act consistently with one another (except in a special case).</p>

<pre><code>var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [1,2,3];

var c = { x: 1, y: 2 };
var d = { x: 1, y: 2 };

var e = "text";
var f = "te" + "xt";

a == b            // false
a === b           // false

c == d            // false
c === d           // false

e == f            // true
e === f           // true
</code></pre>

<p>The special case is when you compare a primitive with an object that evaluates to the same primitive, due to its <code>toString</code> or <code>valueOf</code> method. For example, consider the comparison of a string primitive with a string object created using the <code>String</code> constructor.</p>

<pre><code>"abc" == new String("abc")    // true
"abc" === new String("abc")   // false
</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>==</code> operator is checking the values of the two objects and returning <code>true</code>, but the <code>===</code> is seeing that they're not the same type and returning <code>false</code>.  Which one is correct?  That really depends on what you're trying to compare.  My advice is to bypass the question entirely and just don't use the <code>String</code> constructor to create string objects from string literals.</p>

<p>Using the <code>===</code> operator (<em>Identity</em>)</p>

<pre><code>true === 1; //false

<p>This is because the <strong>equality operator <code>==</code> does type coercion</strong>, meaning that the interpreter implicitly tries to convert the values before comparing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <strong>identity operator <code>===</code> does not do type coercion</strong>, and thus does not convert the values when comparing, and is therefore faster (as according to <a href="http://jsben.ch/JUOm2" rel="noreferrer">This JS benchmark</a> test) as it skips one step.</p>
</tr></td><tr><td><p>There is unlikely to be any performance difference between the two operations in your usage. There is no type-conversion to be done because both parameters are already the same type. Both operations will have a type comparison followed by a value comparison.</p>
</tr></td><tr><td><p>The <strong>===</strong> operator is called a strict comparison operator, it <strong>does</strong> differ from the <strong>==</strong> operator.</p>

<p>Lets take 2 vars a and b.</p>

<p>For <strong>"a == b"</strong> to evaluate to true a and b need to be the <strong>same value</strong>.</p>

<p>In the case of <strong>"a === b"</strong> a and b must be the <strong>same value</strong> and also the <strong>same type</strong> for it to evaluate to true.  </p>

<p>Take the following example</p>

<pre><code>var a = 1;
var b = "1";

if (a == b) //evaluates to true as a and b are both 1
{
    alert("a == b");
}

if (a === b) //evaluates to false as a is not the same type as b
{
    alert("a === b");
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>In summary</strong>; using the <strong>==</strong> operator might evaluate to true in situations where you do not want it to so using the <strong>===</strong> operator would be safer.  </p>

<p>In the 90% usage scenario it won't matter which one you use, but it is handy to know the difference when you get some unexpected behaviour one day.</p>
</tr></td><tr><td><p>In a typical script there will be no performance difference. More important may be the fact that thousand "===" is 1&nbsp;KB heavier than thousand "==" :) <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript+performance">JavaScript profilers</a> can tell you if there is a performance difference in your case.</p>

<p>But personally I would do what JSLint suggests. This recommendation is there not because of performance issues, but because type coercion means <code>('\t\r\n' == 0)</code> is true.</p>
</tr></td><tr><td><p>In the answers here, I didn't read anything about what <strong>equal</strong> means. Some will say that <code>===</code> means <strong>equal and of the same type</strong>, but that's not really true. It actually means that <strong>both operands reference the same object</strong>, or in case of <strong>value types, have the same value</strong>.</p>
<p>So, let's take the following code:</p>
<pre><code>var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [1,2,3];
var c = a;

var ab_eq = (a === b); // false (even though a and b are the same type)
var ac_eq = (a === c); // true
</code></pre>
<p>The same here:</p>
<pre><code>var a = { x: 1, y: 2 };
var b = { x: 1, y: 2 };
var c = a;

var ab_eq = (a === b); // false (even though a and b are the same type)
var ac_eq = (a === c); // true
</code></pre>
<p>Or even:</p>
<pre><code>var a = { };
var b = { };
var c = a;

var ab_eq = (a === b); // false (even though a and b are the same type)
var ac_eq = (a === c); // true
</code></pre>
<p>This behavior is not always obvious. There's more to the story than being equal and being of the same type.</p>
<p>The rule is:</p>
<p><em><strong>For value types (numbers):</strong></em><br />
<code>a === b</code> returns true if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have the same value and are of the same type</p>
<p><em><strong>For reference types:</strong></em><br />
<code>a === b</code> returns true if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> reference the exact same object</p>
<p><em><strong>For strings:</strong></em><br />
<code>a === b</code> returns true if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both strings and contain the exact same characters</p>
<hr />
<h2>Strings: the special case...</h2>
<p>Strings are not value types, but in Javascript they behave like value types, so they will be &quot;equal&quot; when the characters in the string are the same and when they are of the same length (as explained in the third rule)</p>
<p>Now it becomes interesting:</p>
<pre><code>var a = &quot;12&quot; + &quot;3&quot;;
var b = &quot;123&quot;;

alert(a === b); // returns true, because strings behave like value types
</code></pre>
<p>But how about this?:</p>
<pre><code>var a = new String(&quot;123&quot;);
var b = &quot;123&quot;;

alert(a === b); // returns false !! (but they are equal and of the same type)
</code></pre>
<p>I thought strings behave like value types? Well, it depends who you ask... In this case a and b are not the same type. <code>a</code> is of type <code>Object</code>, while <code>b</code> is of type <code>string</code>. Just remember that creating a string object using the <code>String</code> constructor creates something of type <code>Object</code> that behaves as a string <em>most of the time</em>.</p>
</tr></td><tr><td><p>The top 2 answers both mentioned == means equality and === means identity. Unfortunately, this statement is incorrect. </p>

<p>If both operands of == are objects, then they are compared to see if they are the same object. If both operands point to the same object, then the equal operator returns true. Otherwise,
the two are not equal. </p>

<pre><code>var a = [1, 2, 3];  
var b = [1, 2, 3];  
console.log(a == b)  // false  
console.log(a === b) // false  
</code></pre>

<p>In the code above, both == and === get false because a and b are not the same objects.</p>

<p>That's to say: if both operands of == are objects, == behaves same as ===, which also means identity. The essential difference of this two operators is about type conversion. == has conversion before it checks equality, but === does not.</p>

</tr></td><tr><td><p>JavaScript has both strict and typeconverting comparisons. A strict comparison (e.g., <code>===</code>) is only true if the operands are of the same type. The more commonly used abstract comparison (e.g. <code>==</code>) converts the operands to the same Type before making the comparison.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The equality (<code>==</code>) operator converts the operands if they are not of the same type, then applies strict comparison. If either operand is a number or a boolean, the operands are converted to numbers if possible; else if either operand is a string, the string operand is converted to a number if possible. If both operands are objects, then JavaScript compares internal references which are equal when operands refer to the same object in memory.</p>

<p>Syntax:</p>

<p><code>x == y</code></p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>3 == 3     // true
"3" == 3   // true
3 == '3'   // true
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The identity/strict equality(<code>===</code>) operator returns true if the operands are strictly equal (see above) with no type conversion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The weak equality comparison in JavaScript has some confusing behavior and is often the source of confusing bugs.</p>
<p>The solution is to instead use the strict equality operator, which consists of three equal signs: ===. It works exactly like the normal equality operator, but without any type coercion. It's recommended to always use the strict equality operator, and explicitly convert types if needs be.</p>

<p>CoffeeScript solves this by simply replacing all weak comparisons with strict ones, in other words converting all == comparators into ===. You can't do a a weak equality comparison in CoffeeScript, and you should explicitly convert types before comparing them if necessary.</p>

</tr></td><tr><td><p><strong>Why <code>==</code> is so unpredictable?</strong></p>

<p>What do you get when you compare an empty string <code>""</code> with the number zero <code>0</code>?</p>

<p><code>true</code></p>

<p>Yep, that's right according to <code>==</code> an empty string and the number zero are the same time.</p>

<p>And it doesn't end there, here's another one:</p>

<pre><code>'0' == false // true
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Things get really weird with arrays.</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1] == true // true
[] == false // true
[[]] == false // true
[0] == false // true
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Then weirder with strings</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3] == '1,2,3' // true - REALLY?!
'\r\n\t' == 0 // true - Come on!
</code></pre>

<p>It get's worse:</p>

<p><strong>When is equal not equal?</strong></p>

<pre><code>let A = ''  // empty string
let B = 0   // zero
let C = '0' // zero string

A == B // true - ok... 
B == C // true - so far so good...
A == C // **FALSE** - Plot twist!
</code></pre>

<p>Let me say that again:</p>

<pre><code>(A == B) &amp;&amp; (B == C) // true
(A == C) // **FALSE**
</code></pre>

<p>And this is just the crazy stuff you get with primitives.</p>

<p>It's a whole new level of crazy when you use <code>==</code> with objects.</p>

<p>At this point your probably wondering...</p>

<p><strong>Why does this happen?</strong></p>

<p>Well it's because unlike "triple equals" (<code>===</code>) which just checks if two values are the same.</p>

<p><code>==</code> does a <strong><em>whole bunch of other stuff</em></strong>.</p>

<p>It has special handling for functions, special handling for nulls, undefined, strings, you name it.</p>

<p>It get's pretty wacky.</p>

<p>In fact, if you tried to write a function that does what <code>==</code> does it would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function isEqual(x, y) { // if `==` were a function
    if(typeof y === typeof x) return y === x;
    // treat null and undefined the same
    var xIsNothing = (y === undefined) || (y === null);
    var yIsNothing = (x === undefined) || (x === null);

    if(xIsNothing || yIsNothing) return (xIsNothing &amp;&amp; yIsNothing);

    if(typeof y === "function" || typeof x === "function") {
        // if either value is a string 
        // convert the function into a string and compare
        if(typeof x === "string") {
            return x === y.toString();
        } else if(typeof y === "string") {
            return x.toString() === y;
        } 
        return false;
    }

    if(typeof x === "object") x = toPrimitive(x);
    if(typeof y === "object") y = toPrimitive(y);
    if(typeof y === typeof x) return y === x;

    // convert x and y into numbers if they are not already use the "+" trick
    if(typeof x !== "number") x = +x;
    if(typeof y !== "number") y = +y;
    // actually the real `==` is even more complicated than this, especially in ES6
    return x === y;
}

function toPrimitive(obj) {
    var value = obj.valueOf();
    if(obj !== value) return value;
    return obj.toString();
}

<p><strong>So what does this mean?</strong></p>

<p>It means <code>==</code> is complicated.</p>

<p>Because it's complicated it's hard to know what's going to happen when you use it.</p>

<p>Which means you could end up with bugs.</p>

<p><strong>So the moral of the story is...</strong></p>

<p>The only reasonable answer to this question is that </p>

<ol>
<li>You should use <strong>Dynamic Type</strong> comparison e.g.:<code>==</code> for <strong><em>loose Type</em></strong> comparisons. </li>
<li>You should use <strong>Static Type</strong> comparison e.g.:<code>===</code> for <strong><em>strong Type</em></strong> comparisons. </li>
</ol>

<p>That's because they are not the same. They don't have the same purpose and are not meant to be used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Of course both 'forks' and 'spoons' are meant for 'eating', but you will chose to use them accordingly to what you've been served to eat.</p>

<p>Meaning: you'll resolve to using a 'spoon' i.e.: <code>==</code> for having a 'soup', and / or the 'fork' i.e.: <code>===</code> for picking. </p>

<p>Asking if it is better to use a "fork" or a "spoon" for "eating" - is equall to asking if it is better to use a static [===] versus dynamic [==] eq., op. in JS. Both questions are equally wrong and reflect a very narrow or shallow understanding of the subject in question.</p>
</tr></td><tr><td><p>The reason it suggest to replace <code>==</code> with <code>===</code> is that the <code>===</code> operator is more reliable than <code>==</code>. In our context reliable means <code>===</code> also goes for type checking. Considering the best programming practices we should always choose more reliable feature over less reliable one. Again whenever we think about exactly equal to operator most of the time, we are by default consider the type should be same. As <code>===</code> provides the same, we should go for it.</p>
</tr></td><tr><td><p>First, some terminology about Javascript string equals: Double equals is officially known as the abstract equality comparison operator while triple equals is termed the strict equality comparison operator. The difference between them can be summed up as follows: Abstract equality will attempt to resolve the data types via type coercion before making a comparison. Strict equality will return false if the types are different. Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(3 == "3"); // true
console.log(3 === "3"); // false.
console.log(3 == "3"); // true
console.log(3 === "3"); // false.
</code></pre>

<p>Using two equal signs returns true because the string 3 is converted to the number 3 before the comparison is made. Three equal signs sees that the types are different and returns false. Heres another:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(true == '1'); // true
console.log(true === '1'); // false
console.log(true == '1'); // true
console.log(true === '1'); // false
</code></pre>

<p>Again, the abstract equality comparison performs a type conversion. In this case both the boolean true and the string 1 are converted to the number 1 and the result is true. Strict equality returns false.</p>

<p>If you understand that you are well on your way to distinguishing between == and ===. However, theres some scenarios where the behavior of these operators is non intuitive. Lets take a look at some more examples:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(undefined == null); // true
console.log(undefined === null); // false. Undefined and null are distinct types and are not interchangeable.
console.log(undefined == null); // true     
console.log(undefined === null); // false. Undefined and null are distinct types and are not interchangeable.

console.log(true == 'true'); // false. A string will not be converted to a boolean and vice versa.
console.log(true === 'true'); // false
console.log(true == 'true'); // false. A string will not be converted to a boolean and vice versa.
console.log(true === 'true'); // false
</code></pre>

<p>The example below is interesting because it illustrates that string literals are different from string objects.</p>

<pre><code>console.log("This is a string." == new String("This is a string.")); // true
console.log("This is a string." === new String("This is a string.")); // false
console.log("This is a string." == new String("This is a string.")); // true
console.log("This is a string." === new String("This is a string.")); // false
</code></pre>
</tr></td><tr><td><h1>Strict equality is for the most part better</h1>

<p>The fact that Javascript is a loosely typed language needs to be in the front of your mind constantly as you work with it. As long as the data structure is the same there really is no reason as to not use strict equality, with regular equality you often have an implicit conversion of values that happens automatically, this can have far-reaching effects on your code. It is very easy to have problems with this conversion seeing as they happen automatically.</p>

<p>With strict equality there is no automatic implicit conversion as the values must already be of the correct data structure.</p>
