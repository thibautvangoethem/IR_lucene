<p>This is my code:</p>
<pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000;
this.Opacity = trans;
</code></pre>
<p>When I build the application, it gives the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cannot implicitly convert type <code>decimal</code> to <code>double</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have tried using <code>trans</code> and <code>double</code> but then the <code>Control</code> doesn't work. This code worked fine in a past VB.NET project.</p>
<table> <tr><th>answers</th></tr><tr><td><p>An explicit cast to <code>double</code> like this isn't necessary:</p>

<pre><code>double trans = (double) trackBar1.Value / 5000.0;
</code></pre>

<p>Identifying the constant as <code>5000.0</code> (or as <code>5000d</code>) is sufficient:</p>

<pre><code>double trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000.0;
double trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000d;
</code></pre>
</tr></td><tr><td><p>It sounds like <code>this.Opacity</code> is a double value, and the compiler doesn't like you trying to cram a decimal value into it.</p>
</tr></td><tr><td><p><strong>A more generic answer for the generic question &quot;Decimal vs Double?&quot;:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Decimal</strong> is for monetary calculations to preserve the precision. <strong>Double</strong> is for scientific calculations that do not get affected by small differences. Since Double is a type which is native to the CPU (internal representation is stored in <em>base 2</em>), calculations made with Double perform better then Decimal (which is represented in <em>base 10</em> internally).</p>
